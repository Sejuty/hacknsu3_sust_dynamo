As the pandemic situation rises the facility to get health care from private chembers and hospitals is getting more and more difficult. That's why patients are not able to get medical care physically. That's why the need of online healthcare system can improve the overall situation of patients who are in need of health care. 

In this app there are two kinds of users, namely patient and doctors. A doctor can signup and get appointments from the patients and give them proper health services.
On the other hand patients can signup and then they will get either primary health care option or get appointments from specilist doctors where they would be able to get medical insights through zoom.
Here we will also have a option where patients can tell their problems and the app will decide which speciallity of doctors he /she should visit.
